# To-Do-List-Program-
This to-do list program is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks to a list, mark them as completed, and delete them. The program is designed to be visually appealing, with a clean and modern look.

The HTML code consists of a basic structure for a web page, with a container div containing the elements of the to-do list: a heading, an input section for users to enter tasks, and a task list that initially starts empty.

The CSS code is responsible for the styling of the HTML elements, providing a modern and visually appealing design. It uses a font from Google Fonts called "Open Sans" to style the text and provides a white background color and a box shadow to create a shadow effect around the list.

The JavaScript code handles the functionality of the to-do list, allowing users to add tasks to the list, mark them as completed, and delete them. It also stores the list in the browser's local storage so that the list remains even if the user refreshes the page.

Overall, this to-do list program is a simple but useful tool for keeping track of tasks and ensuring productivity.
